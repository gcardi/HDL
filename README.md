# HDL
Informational materials for a course on logic networks, HDLs and programmable logic arrays (FPGAs).

This presentation was used at two informational meetings (a two-part seminar) on behalf of the San Marino Association of Professionals for Digital Innovation (PID).

The seminar's purpose was to acquaint people who work primarily with software with the way modern digital systems are defined and described.

The presentation consisted of slides that supported a spoken description held directly by the authors. The presentation was in Italian.

It takes place in three parts: the first two are carried out during the first meeting. The third part, with a more practical aspect, took place during the second meeting.

The first half of the second part shows the development of a very simple preparatory demonstration project. The rest of the meeting shows how to implement a Manchester transceiver running at megabits on an inexpensive and readily available FPGA. 

The device used in the experiments is Sipeed's TangNano 9K.
